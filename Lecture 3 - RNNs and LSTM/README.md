# SEP789-C02 Week 3 - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long-Short-Term Memory Networks/Layers

In this week of the deep learning course, we explored the use of RNNs and LSTM for tasks such as time series prediction with stock and randomly generated data. During this week, we also looked into some of the example notebooks from the SageMaker service on AWS for RNN toy problem examples. 

We also explored the use of LSTM and its joint use in tasks such as image captioning for our assignment.
