# SEP789-C02-Deep-Learning-and-Applications-Tutorial-and-Exploration-Code

This repository is to store and show case some of the lecture assignments, in-class exercises and concepts that are covered in the SEP789-C02 Deep Learning and Applications class at McMaster University. The notebooks and assignments and contents of the course will undergo a complete overhaul in the next semester, however, what could be said about this course is this: there is not much hand holding involved in this course and a lot of it is independent study for motivated learners. There is not a lot of spoon feeding of the knowledge either, however, the professor is attentive to the questions that the students have about any of the technicalities of the concepts. He provides a lot of online resources to help reinforce concepts and ideas with code to buttress these mental concepts. The resources he recommends are also resources that I have used in the past before enrolling in this course.
